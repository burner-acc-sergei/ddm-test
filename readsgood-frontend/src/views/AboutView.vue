      This is a simple book search app built with <strong>Vue.js</strong> on the front end and a
      <strong>Nest.js</strong> backend. It allows users to search for books by title or keyword
      using the public <strong>Goodreads API</strong>.

      The UI is intentionally minimal â€” I wanted to keep it simple. Though, you can probably tell
      the first thing I added was a dark mode toggle. The app supports basic authentication and
      requires users to connect their Goodreads account to perform searches.

      This app was created by Sergei Lushchik as part of a take-home assignment for DotDash
      Meredith.
